               <h1>Hi, I'm Piyush!</h1>
                <h4>Professional Career</h4>
                <p>I am a UI/UX Designer from New Delhi, India. I currently work as a Product Designer at Paytm. I have a year worth of professional experience working in startups to create products from the ground up. I hold a Bachelor degree in Software Engineering from Delhi Technological University, graduating in 2020. 
                <p> I started off in graphic design during the freshman year of high school.  Winning a few competitions and learning about graphic design software like Gimp and Photoshop. I cleared JEE Mains and decided to join DTU, in 2016. Following a few talks with seniors and given my background in graphic design, I started off in UI design in 2017. 
                <p> I secured my first internship at <a href ="https://www.prepbytes.com/">Prepbytes</a> – a personalised placement training firm. I worked closely with the founders to create designs for the firm’s website. I also did graphic design as well as working with developers to make sure my designs come out pixel perfect.
                <p>  I worked a UX Designer for <a href ="https://www.redcarpetup.com/">RedCarpetUp</a> during the third year of my college. Conducting User Research everyday to redesign a couple of internal apps of the startup. This was the first time I got to work on real wireframes and learn about empathy towards users. 
                <p> During the summer of 2020, I worked with <a href="http://onebanc.ai/">Onebanc</a> to help create a few modules to secure funding for the firm.
                <p>  After graduating, I secured an internship at <a href ="http://nearbuy.com/">nearbuy</a>. I worked primarily as a UI Designer, converting wireframes to UI Design. I also worked on creating and maintaining a component library, handing off designs, illustrations as well as web design.
                <p> As nearbuy got acquired by <a href="https://paytm.com/">Paytm</a>, I was converted to a FTE for Paytm in late September, 2020. I have been working on products of both nearbuy and Paytm since. 
                <h4>Rubik's Cube</h4>
                <p>I first solved a Rubik’s cube in 2011. Learning from YouTube (like I have learned most things in life). Initially, it took me 15 minutes and a piece of paper to solve a 3x3 cube. After almost 10 years of practice and competing, I got it down to less than 10 seconds. I currently enjoy organizing competitions more than solving cubes itself. You can check my competition stats and results <a href ="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2013PASS01">here</a>.</p>
